## About The Project

The "iPhone in React" project is an attempt to recreate the iOS interface and animations using React and Framer Motion.

The project also includes replicating some of the built-in applications available on the iOS platform.

It is purely a personal project that is being worked on in free time for enjoyment and skill-building purposes.
